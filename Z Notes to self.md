## To Do

- Create a blog page
- Add 'skills' section showing icons of all languages etc that I am familiar with (html, css, JS, bootstrap, 11ty, nunjucks, Git and GitHub)
- Add 'see more' card under my projects
- Fix footer not displaying at bottom of pages that are shorter than the screen vh
- CSS styling for card hover, active (dynamic drop shadow, card sizing on hover and click - see bootcamp projects)
- Style contact form as a card with consistent drop shadows to other cards, centre on page
- Add JS functionality for page transitions, navbar collapse on blur
- Crop my photo to remove pint glass (probably not very professional!)
- Rearrange footer content (2024 Rob Codes at bottom)
