aboutContent: This was my second project during my OpenClassrooms bootcamp. Ohmyfood is a food ordering website comprising a homepage and food menu subpages. I built this using HTML, CSS (including Sass), and CSS animations. Using GitHub for version control, my Ohmyfood project showcases my ability to quickly learn new front-end technologies, which provides the user with a responsive, accessible and visually pleasing experience.

skills:
  - HTML
  - CSS (Sass)
  - CSS animations
  - GitHub for version control and website deployment
