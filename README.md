## Notes on work-subpages.json

- The JSON file should be named identically to its folder to work properly.
- In this, we can pass through items such as layout, and this prevents us from having to enter the "layout: work-content.njk" on each separate subpage that uses it.
- The permalink key allows us to change the URL so that it drops the blog/ from the front of the URL.
